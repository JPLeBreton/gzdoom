# gzdoom
GZDoom adds an OpenGL renderer to the ZDoom source port.

# JP's "goodshot" branch
This adds a console command "goodshot" that warps around the level and takes a screenshot from the highest detail PoV it can find.  WADbot ( https://bitbucket.org/JPLeBreton/wadbot ) uses it to post screenshots from random WADs to the web.
